# LiDAR
This project applies filtering, segmentation, and clustering for point cloud data from a LiDAR mounted on top of the car

This project is part of my sensor fusion nano-degree work on Udacity. The c++ code is using custom functions and the PCL library to detect objects. The point cloud data used is generated by a LiDAR mounted on top a car in a road scene.

The project can be seperated into three parts, filteration, segmentation and clustering.
- In filteration, point cloud is downed sampled and cropped to the area of focus.
- In segmentation, a RANSAC algorithm is used for road segmentation.
- In clustering, Kd-tree along with euledian clustering algorithm is applied.

The final output looks like the following:
